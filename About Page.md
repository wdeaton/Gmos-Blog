# About the Author
My name is Wyatt Eaton, I am 22 years old, and recently engaged. 
I am a student at College of the Ozarks where I am currently studying animal science with an empahsis in veterinary. I grew up on a small farm in Missouri. I gradutated high school in 2014, and during high school, plus the years that have followed, I have been watching and studying the events involving GMOs. I think genetics is an interesting topic and I enjoy learning and sharing what I have discovered.
